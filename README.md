GitAx
=====

This is an experimental project, bringing git for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2/R3. Started as a hack, might evolve to something useful.

Model
-----
Right now you can't just clone the repo and code in AX. Current version needs to be imported from a model. You can get the model from a list of [releases](https://github.com/fraga/gitax/releases)

Documentation
-------------
We have a small wiki [here](https://github.com/fraga/gitax/wiki) that will guide you building and contributing.
